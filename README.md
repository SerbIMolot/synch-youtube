# synch-youtube
Website to synchronize youtube watching and potentially other platforms between multiple users. Uses ASP.NET MVC Framework, and EntityFramework as database managment tool.  
Functional, but require testing, debugging, and redesign.  
To test without creating a room, you can try joining a room called "Xsd".
